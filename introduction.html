<h2> Lesson 1,2,3 </h2>
<p> During the first lesson, we were introduced to what we would be doing throughout the course,such as </p>

<br>
<ul>
  <p> web design </p>
  <p> different methods of prototyping </p>
  <p> 3D printing </p>
</ul>

<p> Honestly, i was pretty excited for the latter 2, but i really hated coding and wasn't very keen on coding a website.</p>

<p> However, as you are now reading my website, you can tell that i have changed my views. After watching a few tutorials i found html coding to be fun</p>
<br>
</br>

<p> we were taught of the basic tools we would be using, like philip screwdrivers and glue </p>
