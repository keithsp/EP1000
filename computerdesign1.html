      <p>So this in my opinion, this is the most fun part of the module.</p>
      <p>i have experience in using 3D design software using inventor 2018 for one of my modules in y1</p>
      <P>i also have experience using solidworks in secondary school during my Dnt lessons. </P>
      <P>But by far, fusion is the best software for 3D design i have ever used. it is much more intuitive and easy to get it to do what you want. However i am still inexperienced and i cant get the program to design some freeform shapes that i want. I hope to learn enough of fusion during this module to allow me to freely design whatever i want without any constraints.</P>

      <h2> designing a fidget spinner </h2>

      <p> this was the first task assigned by my teacher <P>

      <p> it involves </p>
      <p>1.Making a circularish(?) shape</p>
      <p>2.Then designing a ball bearing for it</p>
      <p>3.Making somehexagonal nuts as weights</p>

      <p>My idea for designing it was that i wanted a fidget spinner built at an angle, so it would be more comfortable for your hand, as it dosent need to stretch to the ends of the fidget spinner</p>

      <p>so this was the design i came up with</p>

      <p> i made a fidget spinner, angled at a 110 degree angle around the centerline</p>

      <p> i made it so that it wraps around the finger holding the fidget spinner</p>

      <p> i thought it was a pretty challenging design to make<P>

      <p> it was also fun to find out how to make the ball bearing on your own also, in my case i made mine oversized to fit around the large rim of the fidget spinner. designed to be spun around your index finger and your thumb.

    <H2> Laptop Holder </H2>

    <iframe src="https://ichat825.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH919a0QTf3c32634dcf1b2bf6f685a13313?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <p>in contrast to the regular design, i made it as minimalistic as possible, with only 2 different types of parts.</p>

    <p>i sketched my laptop out on a piece of paper then
      wrote my laptop measurements down on it, i feel it makes it easier to visualise and remember</p>
