	<h1> project Management, Web Development and Version Control </h1>

	<p> So we were introduced to github version control, it was really confusing at first, so i didnt really get anything </p>

	<p> But after my teacher explained it to me a 100 times over, i was able to understand a small bit of it</p>

	<p> so i installed github on my computer, and tried to changing my code to test out the version control</p>

	<p> i still didn't get it, but at least i know it does that now </p>
